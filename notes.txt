normal arbitrary routing: stretch = 1, space = nlogn

compact routing in treesï¼šstandard interval routing technique: O(deg(w))

For each vertex w, let fw
be the largest descendant of w. Then, a vertex v is a descendant
of w if and only v 2 [w; fw]. A packet destined for v that arrives
to w is routed as follows: If w = v, the packet has reached its destination. If v 62 [w; fw], the packet is sent to the parent of w, using
the parent pointer of w. Otherwise, a predecessor search among
the children w1; :::; wd of w is performed. If wi is the last child
smaller than or equal to v, the packet is forwarded to wi .
The routing table used at a vertex w is of size O(deg(w)), where
deg(w) is the degree of w. (Each element in this table is dlog2 nebit long.)

b is integer >1
routing tables consisting of O(b) words, and labels (and therefore headers) consisting of O(logb n) word

Weight: sv of a vertex v is the number of its descendants in the tree. (A vertex is considered to be a descendant of itself.)

delta is weighted distance

A is center/landmark

delta(A,v) = min
